                Home mortgage is painful. Not only for borrowers, but also for lenders who work through the mounds of
                paperwork. As part of the process, the credit inquiry is one of the foundational pieces of the loan
                process. However, the
                current credit experience is being challenged by the disparated workflow, manual documentation process,
                and poor communication with borrowers. <br><br>

                Our goal is to ease lender stress by providing a more integrated, automated and collaborative credit
                experience, and
                ultimately, accelerate loan approval.

            </div>
            <p class="body-regular">We interviewed 5 loan officers around their experience pulling credit. Our goals
                were to understand their
                current process and the challenges they face.</p>
            <h3>Poor Legibility</h3>
            <p class="body-regular">
                The current credit report for lenders is long-winded and frustrating,causing the loan officers to often
                miss
                the details they want to catch or misinterpret the information.

            </p>

            <h3>Compromised Workflows
            </h3>
            <p class="body-regular">

                Credit score is not the only deciding factor for loan approval. Ancillary follow-up actions and
                additional communication can be a burden to loan officers due to the manual processing.
            </p>
            <h3>Delayed Responses
            </h3>

            <p class="body-regular">
                Lenders often get contacted out of working schedule. The data indicated that 50% of the documents
                submission happen out of business hours. But the existing mortgage technology has chained the loan
                officers to their desks and computers and they are struggling to make a decision when they are not in
                front of their computers.

            <p class="body-regular">Scrutinizing every single line of credit, requesting
                documents from borrowers, handing off data to the downstream can cause stress, anxiety and uncertainty
                in lenders’ workflow.<br>Understanding the major pain for lenders, we pinpointed the legibility,
                automation, collaboration as our main goals.</p>

        <p class="body-regular">I crafted a new card component to tidy up the information and keep things consistent. On
            mobile, these cards turn into expandable pockets, keeping content tucked away initially. This lets users
            breeze through the essentials, with a choice to unfold the details if they wish.</p>

            processing and anxiety
            for borrowers.
            The new credit service allows lenders and borrowers to collaborate on the same task without manually
            drafting emails. In the meantime, borrowers can worry less and feel supported.
